Search your Google Apps domain for employee info (from a widget)

== Description ==

Enable logged-in users to search your Google Apps employee directory from a widget on your intranet or client site.

Enter search text to see matching names and email addresses, along with profile photos!

**This plugin requires that you also install the free (or premium) version of the popular [Google Apps Login](http://wp-glogin.com/dirgoogleappslogin) plugin**

Setup should take fifteen minutes following our widely-praised instructions.

= Requirements =

Google Apps Directory should work for the following domains:

*  Google Apps for Business
*  Google Apps for Education
*  Google Apps for Non-profits

Google Apps Login plugin setup requires you to have admin access to any Google Apps domain, or a regular Gmail account, to register and
obtain two simple codes from Google.

To use Google Apps Directory, you will also need to register a Service Account with Google and upload details to the Google Apps Login 
plugin's settings page. This is an extra step that you don't need if you set up Google Apps Login alone, or if you use our 
[Google Drive Embedder](http://wp-glogin.com/dirgoogledriveembed) extension plugin.

= Google Apps Login =

The [Google Apps Login](http://wp-glogin.com/dirgoogleappslogin) plugin (which you must also install) 
allows existing Wordpress user accounts to login to the website 
using Google to securely authenticate their account. This means that if they are already logged into Gmail for example,
they can simply click their way through the Wordpress login screen - no username or password is explicitly required!

Full support and premium features are also available for purchase:

Eliminate the need for Google Apps domain admins to separately manage WordPress user accounts, and get peace 
of mind that only authorized employees have access to the organizations's websites and intranet.
